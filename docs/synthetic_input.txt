    "audio_transcript": "Alex: Hey everyone, any ideas for fun things to do this weekend? \nJamie: How about a hike in the hills? The weather is supposed to be amazing. \nSam: We could also check out the farmers' market downtown on Saturday morning. Lots of fresh produce and live music. \nAlex: Sounds good! Maybe in the afternoon we can try that new mini-golf place. I heard it's really fun. \nJamie: I’m in! And maybe we can end the day with ice cream at the lakeside. \nSam: Perfect, and on Sunday we could go kayaking if the weather stays nice. \nAlex: Oh yes, I’ve been wanting to do that. \nJamie: I’ll bring my camera for some scenic shots. \nSam: I can pick up some snacks and drinks for the outing.",
