Analyze the following event inputs:

1. Audio: {audio_transcript_or_description}  
2. Visual media: {photo_or_video_description}  
3. Metadata: {metadata_info}  

Break down the information into the following categories, formatted explicitly for Neo4j:

Requirements:  
- Each distinct location, person, object, action, or other data type must be represented as a node.  
- Include relevant properties for each node (e.g., name, description, attributes, timestamp, device, weather).  
- Identify relationships between nodes (e.g., :LOCATED_AT, :INTERACTS_WITH, :USES, :PART_OF_EVENT).  
- Use full descriptive sentences in the node properties wherever appropriate.  
- Include temporal, emotional, and sensory properties when applicable.  
- If the same entity appears in multiple inputs (like a person or a location), unify it as a single node and reference it in relationships.

Additional Instructions:  
1. Identify all micro-locations separately. Each should be a distinct Location node.  
2. Every person mentioned in audio, visual, or metadata should be a Person node.  
3. Every object, tool, or consumable should be a distinct Object node.  
4. Every activity, task, or gesture should be represented as an Action node, linked to the performing person, objects used, and location.  
5. Sensory data (visual, audio, other senses) should be stored as properties of the relevant nodes (e.g., visual details attached to Location or Media nodes).  
6. Emotional and cognitive insights should be properties of Person nodes.  
7. Temporal sequencing (timestamps and durations) should be included in Action nodes and linked to the Event node.

**Audio Transcript with Visual Context + Metadata (Coworker Weekend Suggestions)**

**Audio Transcript:**  
**Emma:** Hey, welcome to the team! How’s your first week going?  

**You:** Pretty good, thanks! Still trying to figure out what to do around here on the weekends.  

**Emma:** Oh, I totally get that. If you’re looking for something outdoors, there’s a really nice trail up in the hills nearby. Perfect for a hike, especially this weekend—the weather’s supposed to be amazing.  

**Visual Description:** A scenic trail winding through the hills, surrounded by lush green trees under a clear blue sky. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting soft shadows on the path.  

**You:** That sounds great! I could use some fresh air.  

**Emma:** Or, if you’re into local markets, there’s a farmers’ market downtown on Saturday morning. They have fresh produce, flowers, and sometimes even live music. It’s a fun way to get a feel for the city.  

**Visual Description:** Colorful farmers’ market stalls with neatly arranged fruits, vegetables, and flowers. People browse the stalls, sunlight reflecting off the produce. Soft street noise and chatter in the background.  

**You:** Nice, I love farmers’ markets.  

**Emma:** And for something a bit more low-key, there’s a new mini-golf course that just opened. The course looks really fun, and it’s a good afternoon activity.  

**Visual Description:** Three people standing next to a mini-golf course, smiling and pointing at the holes. Bright green turf, colorful golf obstacles, and clear daylight create a lively scene.  

**You:** I’ve never been to mini-golf here, that could be fun.  

**Emma:** We could also end the day at the lakeside with some ice cream. Super relaxing spot to just sit and enjoy the scenery.  

**Visual Description:** A wooden bench by a calm lake, sunlight reflecting on the water. Ice cream cones sit on the bench, with trees and blue sky in the background. Shadows indicate late afternoon sunlight.  

**You:** Sounds like a perfect day!  

**Emma:** If you’re up for it, on Sunday the weather should be good for kayaking. There’s a calm river not far from here. You could bring a friend or even join one of the local rental groups.  

**Visual Description:** Two kayaks resting on a calm river, surrounded by trees lining both banks. Gentle ripples in the water reflect the early morning sun.  

**You:** Oh wow, I’ve never kayaked before, but that sounds exciting.  

**Emma:** I can bring my camera if you want some photos. And I usually pick up some snacks and drinks for these outings too.  

**Visual Description:** A DSLR camera hanging from Emma’s shoulder and a small cooler with snacks and drinks, ready for the trip. The scene is bright, warm, and inviting.  

**You:** That’s awesome, thanks! I think I’ll have a great first weekend exploring.
